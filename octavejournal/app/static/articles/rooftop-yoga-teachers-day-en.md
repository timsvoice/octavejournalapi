In September, we were delighted to host a group of colorfully clad yoga instructors rallied by yoga apparel manufacturer LuLu Lemon.  Leading the teacher’s session was our own Alvaro Estaban.

Thirty-nine certified yoga teachers from the popular yoga apparel company LuLu Lemon joined a one-hour group yoga session on the rooftop of OLR. Led by Octave’s yoga instructor Alvaro Esteban, the teachers worked hard to achieve the goal of “being your unique self.”

“Yoga is not just about posture, it is a way to transform myself, to become a better human,” says Alvaro.“It can help us recognize and change our mental patterns. This is not about becoming someone else, it’s about getting rid of unhealthy ideas, expectations and baggage, and becoming oneself.”

Following the group yoga session, Octave’s program director Dharma Bodhi gave inspiring speech on “The Mystical Origins of Yoga.”

Originated from India, Yoga is now a well-received way of practicing mind-body-self balance in cities like Shanghai where people live a fast-paced, modern lifestyle. Octave integrates the best of Eastern consciousness training with advanced Western anatomy and physiology science to work closely with individuals in achieving mind-body-spirit unity.
