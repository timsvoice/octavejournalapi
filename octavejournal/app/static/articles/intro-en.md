After years of hard work and dedication by all at Octave, we are excited to introduce Octave’s first product: the pilot project, Octave Living Room.

##Thoughts from the Founders
"Transform our world and the world will transform around us. When we feel safe, our earth will be safe. When we become well, all will become well. When we free ourselves, we will free others." - Frederick Chavalit Tsao

[quote from Calvin]

##What is Octave
We started Octave with the inspiration to create communities for personal growth that lead to mindful, fulfilled lives. We are on this path of doing so by providing integrative programming and services that enhances one’s worldview, personal self-discovery and overall wellness.

##We are on our way
OLR is our initial project exemplifying Octave’s vision. As it gradually opens up petal by petal like a flower, we are testing related lifestyle events within OLR, seeking to provide an integrated lifestyle platform for all that join us.

##Congratulations all around
As we continue to move forward, I want to deeply thank all the Octave people that helped make this happen. Let’s move forward together on our journey.
